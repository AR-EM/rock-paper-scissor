# rock-paper-scissor
This is a project for the foundations course of the Odin project.

This projects include the usage of JavaScript to play the famous *rock paper scissors* game.

I learnt JavaScript from the Odin Project and it took me around 2 hours to complete this. I already have a grasp of other languages so it wasn't very difficult.

I have added buttons and javascript with a basic working. I didn't stylise it and I do not plan to. This took me about 50 minutes.
