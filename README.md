# rock-paper-scissor
This is a project for the foundations course of the Odin project.

This projects include the usage of JavaScript to play the famous *rock paper scissors* game in the console.

I learnt JavaScript from the Odin Project and it took me around 2 hours to complete this. I already knew other languages so it wasn't that hard.
